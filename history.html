Once a small fishing village, the city today is a busy port with the distinct advantage of a natural harbour. Its geographical advantage has made this city the headquarters of the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy. In addition, a number of major industries, shipbuilding yard, a huge dry dock, a mega oil refinery, software giants, a massive steel and power plant make Vizag one of the modern faces of India.

    <br>The Victory at Sea Memorial is an Indian memorial constructed after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 which is dedicated to the Indian Navy and the Eastern Naval Command sailors. It was constructed in 1996. It is located on Beach Road, Visakhapatnam.
    In the 1971 liberation war in East Pakistan, the Pakistan Navy targeted the Visakhapatnam Port to destroy the Indian aircraft carrier INS Vikrant but the Indian Navy sunk the Pakistani submarine PNS Ghazi at the coast of Visakhapatnam and took the first battle victory in that war.
